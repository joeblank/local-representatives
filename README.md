### Who's My Representative?

This react app wil allow you to find your local congressional leaders. 

You can search for house representatives, or senators, by state. 

To use this app:

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.

You will also need to use a external API to interact with the `whoismyrepresentative.com` API. That node app can be found [here](https://github.com/hillmanov/find-rep-api).
